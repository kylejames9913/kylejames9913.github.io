# Assignment Final
## Kyle Kredo

This was a lot of fun. Perhaps the most enjoyable assignment. I spent so much time on this and am pleased with the result. It is far from done and far from anything I would use, but I am pleased with what I learned and the obstacles I overcame. Thank you to Michael for all of the help along the way, thank you YouTube, google and W3 school, you guys saved my butt. The biggest struggle that I have yet to solve is the flipping card function for the t shirts. They are not center nor the right size and you can see their block element blocks the nav bar. I tried a lot of things to fix that and got them repositioned and scaled down to a better size but the issue is still there. I also learned what a responsive site was and how I can make mine better. In the future I will have to figure out how to make the nav bar more responsive and even the YouTube links. But I kind of like how they change stacking order when the screen is resized. This was fun and it was cool to see how taking a step back from all the JQuery and all those crazy gaming languages and returning to simple HTML, CSS, and JS can be really powerful. I felt much more capable and confident than at the beginning of the semester and I am confident that with time and practice I can create a really functional site. My next step will be how to figure out when people actually place orders or enter information into forms and stuff like that.
